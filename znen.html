你甚至无法想象的噩梦。						 Nightmares you can't even begin to imagine.

我的血现在就是你的血了。						 My blood is your blood now.

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,115
每次我看到非常奇怪的东西，我就会看到这个符号。						 Every time I see something really weird, I see this symbol.

6
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:25,798
我看过这个。						 I've seen this.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
就像在幻象之类的?						 Like in a vision or something?

8
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:29,802
不，是在隧道的墙上。						 No, on the walls in the tunnels.

9
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:32,125
Victor 说他妈妈想救孩子们						 Victor said his mother wanted to rescue the children

10
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,406
都被锁在塔里了。						 that were locked in the tower.

11
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,248
这是唯一能让大家回家的办法。						 That it was the only way to get everyone home.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,091
一直以来，我以为孩子们是想吓唬我，						 All this time I thought the children were trying to scare me,

13
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,373
但如果他们只是在寻求我的帮助呢?						 but what if they're just asking for my help?

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,175
你听到了吗?						 Do you hear that?

00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,057

我刚想起我的梦。						 I just remembered my dream.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,202
有个男孩穿着一身白色的衣服，						 There was this boy all dressed in white,

00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,606
他一直在重复同样的话。						 and he kept repeating the same phrase.

00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:13,966
“他们来了……						 "Here they come...

29
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,488
“…他们来了三个，						 "...they come for three,

30.
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,650
“除非你停止旋律。”						 "unless you stop the melody."

31
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,613
我知道这个。						 I know that one.

32
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,135
这是一首古老的童谣。						 It's an old nursery rhyme.

33
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,656
"他们碰了，他们断了，						 "They touch, they break,

00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:27,660
"他们偷东西，这里没人是自由的。						 "they steal, no one here is free.

Victor 带 Ethan 去了餐厅。						 Victor took Ethan to the diner.

41

嘿，呃，博伊德……						 Hey, uh, Boyd...

42
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,830
你应该上楼去，以防他们需要你的帮助。						 You should go upstairs just in case they need your help.

43
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:41,574
那孩子应该去挑舞会礼服，						 That kid should be picking out a prom dress,

44
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,539
而不是躺在那里…						 not laying in there like...

45
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:49,023
问题是我们不知道的东西太多了。						 The problem is there's too much we don't know.

46
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,546
就像打开一本书，从中间开始						 It's like opening a book and starting from the middle

47
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:56,909
或者试着想象拼图是什么样子						 or trying to imagine what a jigsaw puzzle looks like

48
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,192
当你只有一些随机的棋子时，对吧?						 when all you have is a few random pieces, right?

49
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,754
甚至不是那些有用的，比如角或边。						 And not even the helpful ones, like corners or edges.

50
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:05,240
只是模糊的他妈的…						 Just vague fucking...

51
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,924
诀窍是你找到两个连接在一起的部分。						 The trick is you find two pieces that connect.

52
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,369
那至少你有个起点了。						 Then at least you have a place to start.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
嘿,嘿。你要去哪里?						 Hey, hey. Where are you going?

54
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,904
我们得和莎拉谈谈。						 We need to talk to Sara.

55
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:49,842
好吧，如果我们再也睡不着了，那还有什么意义呢?						 Well, if we can't sleep anymore, then what's the point?

56
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,884
我跟你说，我们他妈的都该走了。						 I'm telling you, we should all just fucking go.

57
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,247
拿些补给，出发，看看能找到什么。						 Get some supplies, set out, and see what we can find.

58
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,768
Boyd 已经试过了。						 Boyd tried that already.

59
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,610
好吧，也许博伊德不是终极目标，						 Yeah, well, maybe Boyd isn't the end-all,

60
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,212
对一切负责。						 be-all answer to everything.

61
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,895
我们到底在这里做什么?兰德尔是个混蛋。						 What are we even doing out here? Randall was an asshole.

62
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,457
是啊，你也是个混蛋，						 Yeah, well, you're an asshole, too,

63
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,539
我不会让你在这里腐烂						 and I wouldn't leave you out here to rot.

64
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,740
啊，操我。						 Aw, fuck me.

65
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,422
终于从我的房间滚出去了						 Finally get out of my goddamn room

66
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,265
我的职责是收集尸体。						 and I'm on corpse-collecting duty.

67
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,227
去那边看看。						 Go check out down there.

68
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,271
埃尔金，这边走。						 Elgin, this way.

69
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,991
谢谢你的光临。						 Appreciate you coming.

70
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,633
做一些有用的事情感觉很好。						 It feels good to do something useful.

71

哦，你做得够多了。						 Oh, you've done plenty.

72
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:23,316
你的梦想，						 That dream of yours,

73
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:26,479
据我们所知，这将被证明是这个问题的答案。						 for all we know that'll prove to be the answer to this.

74
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,681
虽然这听起来很奇怪。						 Weird as that fucking sounds.

75
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,725
是的,也许吧。						 Yeah, maybe.

76
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,768
你会想看看这个的!						 You're gonna want to see this!

77

我觉得这家伙还没死。						 I don't think this guy's dead.

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,179

00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,821
哦。						 Oh.

81
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,223
你不是说这里会有死去的怪物吗?						 Didn't you say there'd be dead monsters out here?

82
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,029
银弹到此为止了。						 So much for silver bullets.

83
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,630
是的。把他抬上车。						 Yeah. Get him in the van.

84
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,831

耶稣!						 Jesus!

她的脉搏很好，很强劲						 Her pulse is nice and strong

88
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,728
她在深呼吸。						 and she's taking big, deep breaths.

89
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,211
让我看看。						 Let's see here.

90
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,134
我的天啊。哦，我的天。发生什么事情了?						 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's happening?

91
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,656
哦，发生什么事了?我不知道!						 Oh, what's happening? I don't know!

92
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,817
这是怎么呢						 What's going on?

93
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,258
发生什么事情了?我不…我不知道!						 What's happening? I don't... I don't know!

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
-做点什么!-做点什么!						 - Do something! - Do something!

95
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,382
哇，哇，哇，哇!						 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

96
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,463
朱莉!朱莉!						 Julie! Julie!

97
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:31,624
-我的天啊!-这是什么?						 - Oh, my God! - What is this?

98
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,426
我不知道。						 I don't know.

99
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:35,588
Marielle !						 Marielle!

One hundred.
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:38,671
Marielle !						 Marielle!

101
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,353
嘿,嘿。嘿，看着我。						 Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.

102
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,435
玛丽埃尔，玛丽埃尔，跟我说话!						 Marielle, Marielle, talk to me!

103
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,724
那么，这有什么用呢?						 So, how is this supposed to help?

104
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,285
我们在森林里的时候，						 When we were in the forest,

105
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,328
你说有个穿白衣的小男孩叫你到树上去。						 you said a little boy in white told you to get into the tree.

106
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,931
就是这棵树把我关进了那个该死的密室						 It's the same tree that put me in the goddamn chamber

107
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,773
这一切开始的地方。						 where all this started.

108
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,495
所以…						 So...

109
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,498
嗯，原来 Elgin 做了一个关于一个穿白色衣服的小男孩的梦。						 Well, it turns out Elgin had a dream about a little boy in white.

110
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,379
告诉他一段童谣。						 Told him part of a nursery rhyme.

111
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,223
和宝拉死前一直重复的一样。						 The same one Paula kept repeating before she died.

112
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,066
"他们碰，他们破坏，他们偷窃，						 "They touch, they break, they steal,

113
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,068
"这里没有人是自由的。						 "no one here is free.

114
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,750
“他们来了，他们来了三个人，						 "Here they come, they come for three,

115
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,792
“除非你停止旋律。”						 "unless you stop the melody."

116
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,595
这对你来说有意义吗?						 That make any sense to you?

117
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,997
不。						 No.

118
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,522
关于那个小男孩，你还能告诉我些什么吗?						 Anything else you can tell me about the little boy?

119
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,765
他是想帮我们。						 He was trying to help us.

120
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,207
好吧，所以这个随便找来的小孩跑来跑去						 Okay, so this random little kid is running around

121
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,730
一个神奇的森林在做好事?						 a magical forest doing good?

122
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,652
突然出现在人们的梦里，然后……						 Popping up in people's dreams and...

123
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,696
我不认为他真的是个小男孩。						 I don't think he really was a little boy.

124
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,896
来吧。						 Come on.

125
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,940
嘿，Sara，听着。						 Hey, Sara, listen up.

126
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,220
现在就是这样。						 This is it right now.

127
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,302
当我告诉你，你还有机会						 When I told you there was a chance that you could still

128
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,386
做点好事，你可以帮助这里的人们……						 do some good, that you could help the people here...

129
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,868
就是现在，						 It's right now,

130
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,912
你明白吗?						 you understand?

131
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,075
好吧。						 Okay.

132
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,119
就在那边。						 It's right over there.

133
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:13,085
好吧。就是这样。						 All right. This is it.

134
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:17,089
这整件事，整件事就是…有个…						 This whole, whole thing was a... there was a...

135
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,693
有人用铁链拴在这里的墙上。						 There was someone chained to a wall right here.

136
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,294
在这里。然后有个洞						 Right here. Then there was a hole

137
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,336
它下降了四五十英尺。						 that went down 40, 50 feet.

138
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,380
我有……						 And I had...

139
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,501
怎么了?						 What's wrong?

140
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,545
我能听到。						 I can hear it.

141
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,385
音乐。						 The music.

142
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,067
这里的。						 It's here.

143
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,348
你在说什么?						 What are you talking about?

音乐盒。						 The music box.

145
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:38,711
这是……这里的。						 It's... It's here.

146
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,793
在哪里?						 Where?

147

在这里。						 Right there.

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,239
这里的。						 It's here.

149
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,042
有……这里没有八音盒，莎拉。						 There's... There's no music box here, Sara.

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,132
嘿。						 Hey.

309
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,696
你还好吧?						 You all right?

310
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,460
为什么答案显而易见的时候人们总是问这个问题?						 Why do people always ask that when the answer's obvious?

311
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,985
听着，伙计，昨晚的事我很抱歉。						 Look, man, I'm sorry about last night.

312
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,108
把你放在那个房间里，我们只是想…						 Putting you in that room, we were just trying to...

313
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,152
是我的错。						 It was my fault.

314
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,196
我丢了我的屎。						 I lost my shit.

315
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,281
宝拉才是那个在危机中表现出色的人。						 Paula was the one who was good in a crisis.

316
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,288
我从未意识到我们是多么脆弱。						 I never realised how fragile we are.

317
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,212
我们是多么容易破碎。						 How easily we break.

318
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,137
我在楼下像个白痴一样做晚饭。						 I was downstairs making dinner like an idiot.

319
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,385
你已经无能为力了。						 There was nothing you could've done.

320
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,628
这不是谁的错。						 This was nobody's fault.

321
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,874
是的。						 Yeah.

322
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,235
没有人的错。						 Nobody's fault.

323
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,279
是的。						 Yeah.

324
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,728
他怎么样了?						 How's he doing?

325
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,573
我只是无法想象，如果有这样的事情发生，我会怎么做……						 I just can't imagine what I'd do if something like that...

326
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,697
如果是你。						 If it was you.

327
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:11,465
嘿，过来。						 Hey, come here.

328
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
那不是我。						 It wasn't me.

329
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,800
我们结婚吧。						 Let's get married.

330
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,560
今天。						 Today.

331
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,961
是的。						 Yeah.

332
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,963
听着，我们不知道会发生什么，						 Look, we have no idea what's gonna happen,

333
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,288
或者如果你爸爸想办法…						 or if your dad's gonna find a way to...

334
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,577
如果这就是结局，那我希望和你一起结束。						 If this is the end, then I want it to end with you.

335
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,702
我想结婚。						 I wanna get married.

336
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,347
好吧。						 Okay.

337
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,468
好吧?						 Okay?

338
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,912
好吧，是的，当然。是的。						 Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

339
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,418
嗯…						 Uh...

340
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,078
所以，这就是你对我的酒吧所做的?						 So, this is what you're doing with my bar?

341
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,999
这是一个思想实验。						 It's a thought experiment.

342
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,200
啊。						 Ah.

343
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,642
我以前觉得这很有用						 I used to find this helpful

344
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,686
当我在冲洗我的，嗯……						 when I was developing my, um...

345
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,729
你死了。						 You died.

346
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,773
正确的。						 Correct.

347
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,693
好吧。						 Okay.

348
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,137
好吧，我只是想确认一下我们的意见是否一致。						 Well, just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.

349
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:18,350
嗯，你不打算问我是不是真的吗?						 Well, aren't you gonna ask me if I'm real?

350
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,353
我猜这是某种压力引起的精神病，						 I imagine this is some sort of stress-induced psychosis,

351
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:23,397
而你很快就会消失						 and you will disappear soon enough

352
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,877
自己去吧。						 on your own.

353
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,039
那么这一切是用来干什么的呢?						 So what's all this supposed to do?

354
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,121
这是一种重新定位我视角的方式。						 It's a way of reorienting my perspective.

355
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:31,963
我在努力…						 I'm trying to...

356
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:36,448
试图找到一种不同的方式来看待这个符号。						 Trying to find a different way to look at this symbol.

357
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,129
为什么?						 Why?

358
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,173
为什么…						 Why...

359
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,696
因为我一直看错了。						 Because I've been looking at it wrong.

360
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,060
这里一定有个答案，我只是…						 There's gotta be an answer here, I'm just...

361
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,104
我看不出来。						 I'm not seeing it.

362
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,632
你知道我只是想…						 You know I just thought...

363
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:01,072
怎么啦？是什么?						 What? What is it?

364
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,274
你换了蒸馏器。						 You changed the still.

365
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,318
不客气						 You're welcome.

366
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,323
我觉得你想太多了。						 I think you're overthinking it.

367
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:14,808
哦，是吗，死了的汤姆?						 Oh, do you, dead Tom?

368
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,969
以什么方式?嗯?						 In what way? Hmm?

369
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,331
你已经知道你要做什么了。						 You already know what you have to do.

370
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,417
塔比瑟告诉你她在隧道里看到了这个符号。						 Tabitha told you she saw this symbol down in the tunnels.

371
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,537
问题是，						 The question is,

372
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,499
为了寻找答案，你愿意走多远?						 how far are you willing to go to find answers?

373
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,743
下到那些隧道里简直是疯了。						 Going down into those tunnels would be insane.

374
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,624
即使它救了朱莉的命?						 Even if it saves Julie's life?

375
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,586
哦,他妈的。						 Oh, fuck.

376
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,148
你知道，我甚至不知道我能不能在下面找到什么!						 You know, I don't even know if I'd find anything down there!

377
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,192
你当然知道。这是自然设计。						 Of course you do. It's natural design.

378
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,874
和你的大脑在头骨里的原因一样，						 Same reason your brain's in your skull,

379
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,918
你的心脏在肋骨后面。						 your heart's behind your ribs.

380
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,479
大自然总会把最珍贵的东西放上去						 Nature will always put what's most precious

381
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,523
在最难到达的地方。						 in the spots most difficult to reach.

382
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:54,125
这地方一点也不自然。						 Nothing about this place is natural.

383
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,487
错了。						 Wrong.

384
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,531
这地方一点都不熟悉。						 Nothing about this place is familiar.

385
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:00,572
这是有区别的。						 There's a difference.

386
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,337
如果有答案可以找到…						 If there's answers to be found...

387
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,542
当然，那是…这是一个很大的假设，						 And granted, that's a... That's a big if,

388
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,903
他们就在那里。						 that's where they'll be.

389
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,745
好吧，那我该怎么做?						 All right, so I'm supposed to what?

390
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,789
我应该听取一些人的建议……						 I'm supposed to take advice from some...

391
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,391
你跑进了一栋正在倒塌的房子						 You ran into a house that was falling down

392
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,113
去救塔比莎						 to save Tabitha

393
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,355
而她根本不在那里。						 and she wasn't even there.

394
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,877
你知道吗?						 And you know what?

395
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
如果再给我一次选择的机会，我还会做同样的事情。						 Given the choice, I'd do the same thing again.

396
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,162
那你他妈就是个白痴。喜欢……						 Well, then you're a fucking idiot. Like...

397
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,450
你不会基于道德做出选择						 You don't make moral choices based

398
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,132
取决于你所期望的结果。						 on the outcomes you expect.

399
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,777
你是根据你是否认为他们是对的来做决定的。						 You make them based on whether or not you think they're right.

400
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:48,019
当我跑进那所房子的时候，我什么都没想						 When I ran into that house, I wasn't thinking

401
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:51,024
关于电车问题，或者决定论，或者……						 about the Trolley Problem, or determinism, or...

402
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,027
这些我都没想过。						 Wasn't thinking of any of that.

403
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:58,151
那边有个 16 岁的女孩需要你的帮助。						 There's a 16-year-old girl over there who needs your help.

404
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,800
你把宝拉埋了吗?						 Did you bury Paula?

405
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,643
怎么啦？						 What?

406
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,687
你埋葬宝拉了吗?						 Did you bury Paula yet?

407
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,367
耶稣基督。						 Jesus Christ.

408
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:17,448
我来吧。						 I'll do it.

409
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,573
我去找人帮忙。						 I'll go and find some people to help.

410
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:30,301
博伊德?						 Boyd?

411
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:31,823
是的。						 Yeah.

412
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,867
你已经尽力了。						 You're doing the best you can.

413
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,882
他妈的烦!						 Fuck it!

414
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:11,783
你把枪收起来了吗?						 You putting the guns away?

415
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,345
是的。唐娜很担心把它们留在家里。						 Yeah. Donna was worried about leaving them in the house.

416
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,908
不，它很聪明。需要帮忙吗?						 No, it's smart. You need a hand?

417
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
不，我就快做完了。						 No, I'm just about done.

418
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,955
没关系。						 It's okay.

419
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,516
没关系。没关系。						 It's okay. It's okay.

420
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,201
你只是要比我们其他人走得早一点。						 You're just gonna go a little sooner than the rest of us.

421
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,854
一切都是一个系统。						 Everything's a system.

422
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:43,376
所有的连接。						 Everything's connected.

一切都会没事的。						 Everything's gonna be fine.

424
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,995
一切都会没事的。						 Everything's gonna be fine.

425
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,557
操我的命。						 Fuck my life.

426
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,166
不，不，不，不，不!						 No, no, no, no, no, no!

427
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,250
他妈的一坨屎!来吧!						 Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

428
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,564
好吧。						 Okay.

429
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,007
好吧，我知道了。						 Okay, I got this.

430
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,489
容易 peasy。						 Easy peasy.

431
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,412
太他妈容易了。						 Easy fucking peasy.

432
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,083
有人在上面吗?						 Anybody up there?

433
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,688
告诉你吧……						 Tell you what...

434
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,292
如果你在上面……						 If you are up there...

435
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,136
你他妈就是个混蛋，你知道吗?						 You're a real fucking asshole, you know that?

436
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:27,220
你喜欢这个吗?						 You enjoying this?

437
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,272
如果卡特里在这里，卡特里会说，						 If Khatri were here, Khatri would say,

438
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,074
“上帝以神秘的方式行动。”						 "God moves in mysterious ways."

439
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,519
对，对，因为卡特里有个计划。						 Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause Khatri had a plan.

440
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:52,884
他以为你把他放在这里是有原因的。他……						 He thought you put him here for a reason. He...

441
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,286
他以为我们要走到树林里去						 He thought that we were gonna walk out into those woods

442
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,369
就像布奇·卡西迪和他妈的圣丹斯小子一样!						 like Butch Cassidy and the motherfucking Sundance Kid!

443
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:00,211
他一直这么想，直到那个时候						 He thought that right up until the time

444
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,976
其中一个东西割开了他的喉咙!						 one of those things slit his fucking throat!

445
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,139
他咽下最后一口气时做了什么?						 What did he do with his last breaths?

446
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,103
他祈祷。						 He prayed.

447
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:17,028
他喘着气说出了那该死的祷文						 He gasped out that fucking prayer

448
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,072
这样你就会知道。						 so that you would know.

449
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:26,077
这样他就可以向你证明他从未失去信心。						 So that he could show you that he had never lost faith.

450
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,121
你知道吗，王八蛋?						 You know what, motherfucker?

451
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,123
我不是来祈祷的。						 I ain't here to pray.

452
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,207
如果你不是什么睡前故事						 If you are anything other than some bedtime fucking story

453
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,211
这是我们告诉自己的，然后你会告诉我为什么!						 that we tell ourselves, then you will tell me why!

454
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:44,095
你为什么让我觉得我能搞定这事?						 Why you made me think I could fix this?

455
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:47,939
某个他妈的英雄会带领这些人回家，						 Some kind of fucking hero gonna lead these people home,

456
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,461
而我只是个愚蠢的混蛋						 when all I am is a dumb motherfucker

457
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,545
是谁一直让人被杀!						 who keeps getting people killed!

458
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,427
该死的!						 Damn it!

459
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:59,150
你他妈的。你觉得这很好笑?						 You fuck. You think this is funny?

460
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:03,034
嗯?你他妈在那儿笑吗?						 Huh? You up there somewhere having a fucking laugh?

461
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,516
嗯?嗯?						 Huh? Huh?

462
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:07,560
只是…回答我!						 Just... answer me!

说点什么!						 Say something!

466
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,767
你知道的…						 You know...

467
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,891
篡改邮箱是联邦犯罪。						 Tampering with a mailbox is a federal crime.

468
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:30,944
进来。						 Come in.

她怎么样了?						 How's she doing?

00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,994
她越来越糟了。						 She's getting worse.

471

她，嗯，她有点冷了。						 She's, um, she's getting cold.

真的是这样吗?						 Is this really it?

00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:04,137
这就是结局吗?						 Is this how it ends?

474
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,022
我不知道。						 I don't know.

475
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:13,744
你知道，自从她走下巴士						 You know, ever since she walked off that bus

476
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:16,988
我实际上允许自己						 I actually allowed myself

477
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,712
去相信这一切都是有计划的。						 to believe that there was a plan to all of this.

478
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:27,800
我们注定要在这里做些什么。						 That there was something we were meant to do here.

479
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,843
但是没有……						 But there's no...

480
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,767
没有什么宏伟的设计。						 There's no grand design.

481
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,171
我们都会死在这里。						 We're all gonna die here.

482
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:41,254
而这一切都将化为乌有。						 And all this would have been for nothing.

483
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:47,220
你知道，我爸爸曾经说过，						 You know, my dad used to say,

484
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,540
“毛衣很难看清						 "It's hard to see the sweater

00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,584
“当你只是一根线。”						 "when you're only just a thread."

486
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,828
直到现在我才真正明白他的意思。						 I didn't really know what he meant 'til now.

487
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,393
所有被困在这里的人…						 All of the people that have gotten stuck here...

488
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:07,040
也许我们不是回家的人，						 Maybe we aren't the ones that get to go home,

489
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:12,125
但也许我们在这里所做的						 but maybe what we did here

490
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,569
让下一个来的人更容易。						 makes it easier for the people who come next.

491
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,693
也许我们就是他们能回家的原因。						 Maybe we're the reason that they get to go home.

492
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,618
只因为我们只是一根线						 Just because we're only a thread

493
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,662
不代表我们不重要。						 doesn't mean we don't matter.

494
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,552
好了。						 There ya go.

495
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,794
你最不需要的就是 Khatri 缠着你						 Last thing you need is Khatri haunting you

496
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,838
凌驾于一切之上。						 over everything else.

497
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,602
太晚了。						 It's too late for that.

498
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,169
Julie 和 Marielle。						 Julie and Marielle.

499
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,611
兰德尔。						 Randall.

00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,136
Sara 说他们快死了。						 Sara says they're dying.

501
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,296
一旦他们走了，						 And once they're gone,

502
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:08,179
不可能把精灵放回瓶子里。						 there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.

503
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:11,222
不管这东西是什么，它都在等着我们						 Whatever this thing is, it just waits for us

504
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,266
去睡觉，然后……						 to go to sleep and then...

505
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,267
像宝拉。						 Like Paula.

506
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,311
是的。						 Yeah.

507
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,753
她说音乐盒在那儿，						 She said the music box is there,

508
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,835
就在那块空地上。						 right there in the clearing.

509
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:26,879
只是它不在那里。						 Only it's not there.

510
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:30,761
就像看说明书一样						 Like looking at an instruction manual

511
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,243
缺了太多的页。						 with too many pages missing.

512
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,647
我怎么…我怎么…						 How am I... How am I supposed...

513
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,092
我昨晚看到我妻子了。						 I saw my wife last night.

514
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:43,096
她看起来怎么样?						 How'd she look?

515
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,341
总会有规矩的，唐娜。						 There's gotta be rules, Donna.

516
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:54,305
总有什么东西能让我握在手里。						 There's gotta be something I can hold in my hands.

517
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:56,349
肯定有那么…						 There's got to be so...

518
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,074
我做了这个。						 I did this.

519
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,477
我把这东西带回来了。						 I brought this thing back here.

520

是的。是的。						 Yup. You sure did.

521
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:11,762
你也给了一群人更多的时间						 You also gave a whole bunch of people a lot more time

522
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,806
如果不是因为你，他们早就知道了。						 than they would've had if wasn't for you.

523

你给了我更多的时间。						 You gave me more time.

00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,098
我们已经没有牧师了。						 It's not like we have a priest anymore.

527
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,184
他们在充分利用他们拥有的时间。						 They're making the most of whatever time they have.

528
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:35,506
你也应该这样做。						 You should do the same.

00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,950
跟我回殖民地大厦去。						 Come back to Colony House with me.

530
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:43,514
我不会放弃的。						 I'm not giving up.

00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:46,397
我说放弃了吗?						 Did I say give up?

532
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:52,203
博伊德，这可能是我们最后几个小时了。						 Boyd, this may be the last few hours any of us get.

533
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,085
所以，你就不能别再当他妈的殉道者了						 So, why don't you just stop being a goddamn martyr

534
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,770
过来看你儿子结婚。						 and come and watch your son get married.

仪式结束后，世界末日还会在这里。						 The end of the world'll still be here when the ceremony's done.

你妈妈还说了其他关于孩子的事吗?						 Did your mother say anything else about the children?

00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,880
她要怎么救他们呢?						 How was she gonna save them?

549
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,041
我不知道。她就这么说了						 I don't know. All she said was that

550
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,085
他们需要她。						 they needed her.

551
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,769
这是……应该是对的……在这里。						 It's... It should be right... right here.

嘿，嘿，嘿。那是很久以前的事了，维克多。						 Hey, hey, hey. It was a long time ago, Victor.

554
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:07,938
也许……也许我们拐错弯了。						 Maybe... Maybe we took the wrong turn.

555
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:11,221
在…在这里。						 Over... Over here.

556
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,669
谁把瓶子放在那里的?						 Who put the bottles there?

557
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,432
我不知道。						 I don't know.

558
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:26,919
这就是我找到她的地方。						 This is where I found her.

559
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:30,160
你的妈妈?						 Your mom?

560
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:33,724
是啊，大家都死了之后，我来找她。						 Yeah, after everyone died, I came looking for her.

561
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,768
她的身体…						 Her body was...

562
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:42,294
她没能爬进树里。						 She didn't make it into the tree.

563
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:47,940
你说到树上是什么意思?						 What do you mean into the tree?

00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,781
哦。						 Oh.

565

来了。						 Come.

那是一棵很远的树。						 It's a faraway tree.

567
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
怪物进入殖民地屋的那天晚上						 The night the monsters got into Colony House,

568
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:14,004
朱莉说你们俩都是爬到树上逃出来的。						 Julie said you both escaped by climbing into a tree.

569
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,966
他们总是带你去不同的地方，						 They always take you different places,

570
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,969
你永远不知道你会在哪里结束，						 and you never know where you'll end up,

571
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:22,893
但是我妈妈说这个很特别。						 but my mother said this one was special.

572
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,775
它会把她带到塔里，						 That it would take her to the tower,

573
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:26,817
给孩子们。						 to the children.

我在里面给你放了些零食。						 I put some snacks inside for you.

580

00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,733
走过去会痛吗?						 Does it hurt to go through?

584
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,137
不，这就像穿过一扇门。						 No, it's just like walking through a door.

585
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:09,019
好吧。毫米。						 Okay. Mm.

00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,504
好吧。谢谢你！						 Okay. Thank you.

587

现在回城里去吧。						 Now go back to town.

588
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:22,394
小心些而已。						 Be careful.

589
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,117
是的。						 Yeah.

590
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:01,994
我的天啊。						 Oh, my God.

591
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,254
我们在做什么?						 What are we doing?

592

他希望这是一个惊喜。						 He wanted it to be a surprise.

593
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,621
他想要什么作为惊喜?						 He wanted what to be a surprise?

594
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:34,424
你总说这景色让这地方变得更美						 You're always saying that this view makes even this place

595
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,870
看起来像一场梦，所以我想。						 look like a dream, so I figured.

596
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,672
这样可以吗?						 Is this okay?

597
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,716
这是完美的。						 This is perfect.

598
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:54,044
嘿，我们为什么不直接去找他呢?						 Hey, why don't we just go get him?

599
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,088
他脑子里有很多事，你知道吗?						 He's got a lot on his mind, you know?

600
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,852
警长史蒂文斯!						 Sheriff Stevens!

601
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:01,371
你做到了。						 You made it.

602
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,453
什么，你在开玩笑吗?						 What, are you kidding me?

603
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:05,497
野马也挡不住我。						 Wild horses couldn't stop me.

604
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,299
好吧。						 Okay.

605
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:10,741
让我们开始表演吧。						 Let's get this show on the road.

606
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:12,785
好的,等待。嗯…						 Okay, wait. Um...

607
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,147
我知道这不是一个很大的通道						 I know it's not much of an aisle,

608
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:20,833
但是你能给我这个荣幸吗?						 but would you do me the honour?

609
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,400
好了，准备好了吗?是的。						 All right, you ready? Yeah.

610
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:33,125
你也不用再叫我史蒂文斯警长了。						 And you don't have to call me Sheriff Stevens anymore.

611
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,528
好吧。						 Okay.

我父亲有句话。						 My father had a saying.

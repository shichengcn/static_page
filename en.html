00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:02,615
 Previously on From...

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:04,657
 There's darkness in the forest.

3.
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:07,340
 Nightmares you can't even begin to imagine.

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,028
 My blood is your blood now.

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,115
 Every time I see something really weird, I see this symbol.

6
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:25,798
 I've seen this.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
 Like in a vision or something?

8
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:29,802
 No, on the walls in the tunnels.

9
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:32,125
 Victor said his mother wanted to rescue the children

10
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,406
 that were locked in the tower.

11
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,248
 That it was the only way to get everyone home.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,091
 All this time I thought the children were trying to scare me,

13
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,373
 but what if they're just asking for my help?

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,175
 Do you hear that?

15
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,057
 Help me!

16
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,739
 Please! Please, I need help!

17
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,022
 She was talking in her sleep.

18
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:50,423
 What did she say?

19
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:53,228
 "They touch, they break, they steal.

20.
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:55,908
 No one here is free."

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,751
 There's something else here now. Something new.

22
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,833
 It's not safe for anyone to go to sleep tonight.

23
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,195
 Every one of you... Get him upstairs!

24
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,317
 ...is gonna fucking die! Get him outta here now!

25
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,878
 I just remembered my dream.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,202
 There was this boy all dressed in white,

27
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,606
 and he kept repeating the same phrase.

28
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:13,966
 "Here they come...

29
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,488
 "...they come for three,

30.
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,650
 "unless you stop the melody."

31
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,613
 I know that one.

32
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,135
 It's an old nursery rhyme.

33
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,656
 "They touch, they break,

34
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:27,660
 "they steal, no one here is free.

35
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:31,264
 "Here they come, they come for three,

36
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:32,785
 "unless you stop the melody."

37
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:33,906
 Julie! Stop!

38
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,728
 They're upstairs.

39
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:05,420
 Your mom and...

40
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,103
 Victor took Ethan to the diner.

41
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,786
 Hey, uh, Boyd...

42
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,830
 You should go upstairs just in case they need your help.

43
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:41,574
 That kid should be picking out a prom dress,

44
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,539
 not laying in there like...

45
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:49,023
 The problem is there's too much we don't know.

46
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,546
 It's like opening a book and starting from the middle

47
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:56,909
 or trying to imagine what a jigsaw puzzle looks like

48
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,192
 when all you have is a few random pieces, right?

49
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,754
 And not even the helpful ones, like corners or edges.

50
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:05,240
 Just vague fucking...

51
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,924
 The trick is you find two pieces that connect.

52
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,369
 Then at least you have a place to start.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
 Hey, hey. Where are you going?

54
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,904
 We need to talk to Sara.

55
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:49,842
 Well, if we can't sleep anymore, then what's the point?

56
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,884
 I'm telling you, we should all just fucking go.

57
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,247
 Get some supplies, set out, and see what we can find.

58
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,768
 Boyd tried that already.

59
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,610
 Yeah, well, maybe Boyd isn't the end-all,

60
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,212
 be-all answer to everything.

61
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,895
 What are we even doing out here? Randall was an asshole.

62
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,457
 Yeah, well, you're an asshole, too,

63
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,539
 and I wouldn't leave you out here to rot.

64
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,740
 Aw, fuck me.

65
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,422
 Finally get out of my goddamn room

66
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,265
 and I'm on corpse-collecting duty.

67
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,227
 Go check out down there.

68
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,271
 Elgin, this way.

69
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,991
 Appreciate you coming.

70
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,633
 It feels good to do something useful.

71
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:21,914
 Oh, you've done plenty.

72
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:23,316
 That dream of yours,

73
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:26,479
 for all we know that'll prove to be the answer to this.

74
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,681
 Weird as that fucking sounds.

75
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,725
 Yeah, maybe.

76
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,768
 You're gonna want to see this!

77
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,373
 I don't think this guy's dead.

78
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,417
 Oh, shit.

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,179
 Fuck.

80
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,821
 Oh.

81
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,223
 Didn't you say there'd be dead monsters out here?

82
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,029
 So much for silver bullets.

83
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,630
 Yeah. Get him in the van.

84
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,831
 Aw, fuck.

85
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,875
 Get him in the van! Okay.

86
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:04,837
 Jesus!

87
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,324
 Her pulse is nice and strong

88
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,728
 and she's taking big, deep breaths.

89
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,211
 Let's see here.

90
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,134
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's happening?

91
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,656
 Oh, what's happening? I don't know!

92
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,817
 What's going on?

93
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,258
 What's happening? I don't... I don't know!

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
 - Do something! - Do something!

95
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,382
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

96
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,463
 Julie! Julie!

97
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:31,624
 - Oh, my God! - What is this?

98
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,426
 I don't know.

99
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:35,588
 Marielle!

One hundred.
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:38,671
 Marielle!

101
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,353
 Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.

102
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,435
 Marielle, Marielle, talk to me!

103
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,724
 So, how is this supposed to help?

104
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,285
 When we were in the forest,

105
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,328
 you said a little boy in white told you to get into the tree.

106
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,931
 It's the same tree that put me in the goddamn chamber

107
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,773
 where all this started.

108
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,495
 So...

109
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,498
 Well, it turns out Elgin had a dream about a little boy in white.

110
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,379
 Told him part of a nursery rhyme.

111
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,223
 The same one Paula kept repeating before she died.

112
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,066
 "They touch, they break, they steal,

113
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,068
 "no one here is free.

114
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,750
 "Here they come, they come for three,

115
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,792
 "unless you stop the melody."

116
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,595
 That make any sense to you?

117
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,997
 No.

118
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,522
 Anything else you can tell me about the little boy?

119
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,765
 He was trying to help us.

120
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,207
 Okay, so this random little kid is running around

121
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,730
 a magical forest doing good?

122
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,652
 Popping up in people's dreams and...

123
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,696
 I don't think he really was a little boy.

124
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,896
 Come on.

125
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,940
 Hey, Sara, listen up.

126
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,220
 This is it right now.

127
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,302
 When I told you there was a chance that you could still

128
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,386
 do some good, that you could help the people here...

129
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,868
 It's right now,

130
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,912
 you understand?

131
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,075
 Okay.

132
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,119
 It's right over there.

133
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:13,085
 All right. This is it.

134
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:17,089
 This whole, whole thing was a... there was a...

135
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,693
 There was someone chained to a wall right here.

136
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,294
 Right here. Then there was a hole

137
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,336
 that went down 40, 50 feet.

138
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,380
 And I had...

139
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,501
 What's wrong?

140
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,545
 I can hear it.

141
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,385
 The music.

142
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,067
 It's here.

143
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,348
 What are you talking about?

144
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,590
 The music box.

145
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:38,711
 It's... It's here.

146
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,793
 Where?

147
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:42,194
 Right there.

148
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,239
 It's here.

149
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,042
 There's... There's no music box here, Sara.

150
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,645
 Yeah, no, there is. There is.

151
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:56,170
 I can... I can hear it, I'm telling you, I... I can...

152
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,452
 What's wrong?

153
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,261
 What's wrong?

154
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,702
 I can hear them screaming.

155
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,746
 What?

156
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,947
 There's... There's... There's something.

157
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,829
 There's something.

158
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:18,911
 It's here.

159
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,955
 It's hurting them.

160
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,518
 Boyd, what the fuck is going on?

161
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,641
 Hey, Sara, Sara. Talk... Talk... Talk to me.

162
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:31,325
 "Here they come, they come for three."

163
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,287
 It needs them!

164
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,370
 It needs them to stay. It needs them to...

165
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:39,571
 Okay.

166
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,573
 Okay. We gotta get her out of here. Come on.

167
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:43,255
 Kenny, Kenny, come on! Yeah.

168
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,937
 Come on, come on, come on, buddy.

169
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,820
 Lift up. There we go. Come on.

170
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,222
 It's all right. It's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

171
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,905
 No, don't! Stop! Stop!

172
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:55,828
 Okay. Okay.

173
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,872
 Okay. Okay.

174
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,433
 All right.

175
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:03,155
 It's laughing at you.

176
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,276
 What?

177
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,598
 For bringing it back to town.

178
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,642
 For setting it free.

179
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,246
 It wants to hurt us.

180
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,131
 It wants to make us suffer.

181
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,013
 It got so excited

182
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,057
 when it touched your arm.

183
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,538
 How do I stop this? Sara?

184
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,700
 How do I stop it?

185
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:29,021
 Julie. Julie?

186
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,062
 Julie.

187
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:32,106
 Julie? Julie.

188
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,709
 Ju... Julie.

189
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,109
 Julie.

190
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:39,153
 Julie and the others. Yeah.

191
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,914
 They're dying.

192
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,958
 They're dying.

193
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:47,079
 And when they die,

194
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,400
 it'll be too late.

195
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,324
 You need to make it stop!

196
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,006
 Okay. Make what stop?

197
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,688
 The music! The music!

198
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,369
 You have to make the music stop!

199
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,410
 Okay, how?

200
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,452
 How do I stop something I can't see?

201
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:01,533
 I don't know!

202
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:02,775
 Okay, okay, okay.

203
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,979
 Oh. All right. All right.

204
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,502
 Okay.

205
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,466
 Just breathe.

206
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:18,951
 That's it.

207
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,995
 Just breathe.

208
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,275
 Close your eyes.

209
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,557
 Let's pray.

210
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,720
 Yea, though I walk through

211
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,044
 the valley of the shadow of death...

212
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:35,047
 I will fear no evil,

213
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,252
 for Thou art with me.

214
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:42,456
 Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me...

215
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,501
 Matthias?

216
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,863
 Take the guns and lock them in the shed.

217
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,265
 I don't want them in the house.

218
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,987
 We managed to make it through the night.

219
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,668
 Now we just have to see about today.

220
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,712
 Okay.

221
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,525
 Jim.

222
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,569
 Come on.

223
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,502
 There's something I have to do,

224
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,546
 and I need you to say it's okay.

225
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,427
 The last time Victor saw his mother,

226
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:38,430
 she told him that there were children locked in a tower.

227
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:39,992
 That if she helped them,

228
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:42,036
 then everyone could go home.

229
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,196
 I don't understand.

230
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,879
 All... All these children I've been seeing,

231
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,643
 the dreams I've been having about a tower...

232
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,246
 What if she was right?

233
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,449
 What if the only way to save Julie is to find that tower?

234
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,530
 Tabby...

235
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,092
 Honey, I know, I know it sounds crazy.

236
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,693
 I had a theory about this place

237
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,737
 that almost got me killed.

238
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,537
 Well, this is different.

239
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,581
 How?

240
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,662
 It just is.

241
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,946
 Jim, our daughter is laying in that room

242
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,990
 like something out of a nightmare.

243
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,513
 She called for me last night,

244
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,877
 and I couldn't do anything to help her.

245
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,281
 I was just standing there...

246
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,043
 And all I could think and see was

247
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,287
 Thomas lying on the fucking floor.

248
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,931
 I can't. I can't, Jim.

249
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,736
 We can't sit here hoping for the best.

250
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,620
 Victor's mother left this place,

251
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,664
 and she never came back.

252
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,308
 Whatever she went to do, she never came back.

253
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:01,073
 Victor had to grow up here alone.

254
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:02,875
 What if that happens to you?

255
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,919
 I know.

256
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,804
 That's why I need you to tell me that it's okay for me to go.

257
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,888
 I have to try this, Jim. Please.

258
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,132
 When Julie wakes up, she's gonna be hungry.

259
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:22,174
 We make her favourite.

260
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:23,615
 Hey. We brought home food.

261
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,137
 Oh, good.

262
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:28,860
 Um, Victor, can I talk to you for a minute, please?

263
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,904
 Is Victor in trouble?

264
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,025
 No, no.

265
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,069
 You come help me.

266
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,955
 Uh...

267
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:45,157
 You said your mother wanted to rescue the children

268
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,201
 that were locked in the tower.

269
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,607
 Do you know the way to the tower?

270
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,331
 Mm.

271
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,936
 But I... I know the way

272
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:05,497
 to the bottle tree.

273
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,541
 The what?

274
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,475
 This is how you get to the tower.

275
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,321
 You... You have to visit the bottle tree.

276
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,447
 Can you take me there?

277
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,288
 I think so.

278
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,332
 Can you give us a second?

279
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,783
 Jim, I have to try this.

280
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,109
 I have to at least try.

281
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,394
 I just...

282
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:05,359
 I know. I know. I know, baby. I know.

283
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,411
 So, what are we supposed to do?

284
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,500
 We head back to town.

285
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,021
 Wait, wait, wait, what?

286
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:31,343
 She just said that the music box is here.

287
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,105
 It's here. We have to find it, we have to...

288
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,666
 Yeah, how do you expect we do that?

289
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,228
 I don't know,

290
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,351
 but I'm pretty sure it's not by going back into town!

291
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,473
 People's lives are at stake here!

292
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,797
 Hey, I don't need a fucking reminder of what's at stake!

293
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:52,284
 There's nothing we can do here. Not yet.

294
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,929
 Look, we're dealing with things that are beyond our scope of...

295
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,013
 We know more now than we knew this morning.

296
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,095
 That's a win.

297
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,216
 Okay.

298
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,260
 Yeah. So, what are we...

299
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,301
 What are we supposed to tell people?

300
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,183
 We tell people that we are working on it.

301
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,066
 The best thing we can do now is help people

302
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,548
 feel a little more calmer.

303
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,870
 Help 'em feel less afraid.

304
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,914
 Can you do that?

305
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,476
 Yeah.

306
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,037
 Yeah.

307
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,199
 Good man.

308
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,132
 Hey.

309
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,696
 You all right?

310
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,460
 Why do people always ask that when the answer's obvious?

311
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,985
 Look, man, I'm sorry about last night.

312
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,108
 Putting you in that room, we were just trying to...

313
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,152
 It was my fault.

314
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,196
 I lost my shit.

315
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,281
 Paula was the one who was good in a crisis.

316
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,288
 I never realised how fragile we are.

317
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,212
 How easily we break.

318
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,137
 I was downstairs making dinner like an idiot.

319
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,385
 There was nothing you could've done.

320
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,628
 This was nobody's fault.

321
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,874
 Yeah.

322
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,235
 Nobody's fault.

323
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,279
 Yeah.

324
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,728
 How's he doing?

325
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,573
 I just can't imagine what I'd do if something like that...

326
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,697
 If it was you.

327
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:11,465
 Hey, come here.

328
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
 It wasn't me.

329
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,800
 Let's get married.

330
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,560
 Today.

331
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,961
 Yeah.

332
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,963
 Look, we have no idea what's gonna happen,

333
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,288
 or if your dad's gonna find a way to...

334
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,577
 If this is the end, then I want it to end with you.

335
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,702
 I wanna get married.

336
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,347
 Okay.

337
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,468
 Okay?

338
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,912
 Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

339
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,418
 Uh...

340
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,078
 So, this is what you're doing with my bar?

341
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,999
 It's a thought experiment.

342
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,200
 Ah.

343
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,642
 I used to find this helpful

344
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,686
 when I was developing my, um...

345
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,729
 You died.

346
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,773
 Correct.

347
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,693
 Okay.

348
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,137
 Well, just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.

349
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:18,350
 Well, aren't you gonna ask me if I'm real?

350
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,353
 I imagine this is some sort of stress-induced psychosis,

351
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:23,397
 and you will disappear soon enough

352
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,877
 on your own.

353
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,039
 So what's all this supposed to do?

354
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,121
 It's a way of reorienting my perspective.

355
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:31,963
 I'm trying to...

356
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:36,448
 Trying to find a different way to look at this symbol.

357
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,129
 Why?

358
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,173
 Why...

359
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,696
 Because I've been looking at it wrong.

360
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,060
 There's gotta be an answer here, I'm just...

361
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,104
 I'm not seeing it.

362
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,632
 You know I just thought...

363
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:01,072
 What? What is it?

364
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,274
 You changed the still.

365
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,318
 You're welcome.

366
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,323
 I think you're overthinking it.

367
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:14,808
 Oh, do you, dead Tom?

368
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,969
 In what way? Hmm?

369
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,331
 You already know what you have to do.

370
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,417
 Tabitha told you she saw this symbol down in the tunnels.

371
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,537
 The question is,

372
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,499
 how far are you willing to go to find answers?

373
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,743
 Going down into those tunnels would be insane.

374
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,624
 Even if it saves Julie's life?

375
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,586
 Oh, fuck.

376
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,148
 You know, I don't even know if I'd find anything down there!

377
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,192
 Of course you do. It's natural design.

378
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,874
 Same reason your brain's in your skull,

379
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,918
 your heart's behind your ribs.

380
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,479
 Nature will always put what's most precious

381
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,523
 in the spots most difficult to reach.

382
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:54,125
 Nothing about this place is natural.

383
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,487
 Wrong.

384
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,531
 Nothing about this place is familiar.

385
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:00,572
 There's a difference.

386
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,337
 If there's answers to be found...

387
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,542
 And granted, that's a... That's a big if,

388
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,903
 that's where they'll be.

389
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,745
 All right, so I'm supposed to what?

390
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,789
 I'm supposed to take advice from some...

391
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,391
 You ran into a house that was falling down

392
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,113
 to save Tabitha

393
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,355
 and she wasn't even there.

394
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,877
 And you know what?

395
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
 Given the choice, I'd do the same thing again.

396
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,162
 Well, then you're a fucking idiot. Like...

397
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,450
 You don't make moral choices based

398
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,132
 on the outcomes you expect.

399
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,777
 You make them based on whether or not you think they're right.

400
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:48,019
 When I ran into that house, I wasn't thinking

401
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:51,024
 about the Trolley Problem, or determinism, or...

402
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,027
 Wasn't thinking of any of that.

403
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:58,151
 There's a 16-year-old girl over there who needs your help.

404
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,800
 Did you bury Paula?

405
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,643
 What?

406
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,687
 Did you bury Paula yet?

407
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,367
 Jesus Christ.

408
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:17,448
 I'll do it.

409
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,573
 I'll go and find some people to help.

410
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:30,301
 Boyd?

411
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:31,823
 Yeah.

412
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,867
 You're doing the best you can.

413
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,882
 Fuck it!

414
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:11,783
 You putting the guns away?

415
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,345
 Yeah. Donna was worried about leaving them in the house.

416
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,908
 No, it's smart. You need a hand?

417
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
 No, I'm just about done.

418
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,955
 It's okay.

419
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,516
 It's okay. It's okay.

420
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,201
 You're just gonna go a little sooner than the rest of us.

421
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,854
 Everything's a system.

422
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:43,376
 Everything's connected.

423
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,951
 Everything's gonna be fine.

424
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,995
 Everything's gonna be fine.

425
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,557
 Fuck my life.

426
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,166
 No, no, no, no, no, no!

427
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,250
 Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

428
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,564
 Okay.

429
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,007
 Okay, I got this.

430
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,489
 Easy peasy.

431
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,412
 Easy fucking peasy.

432
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,083
 Anybody up there?

433
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,688
 Tell you what...

434
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,292
 If you are up there...

435
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,136
 You're a real fucking asshole, you know that?

436
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:27,220
 You enjoying this?

437
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,272
 If Khatri were here, Khatri would say,

438
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,074
 "God moves in mysterious ways."

439
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,519
 Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause Khatri had a plan.

440
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:52,884
 He thought you put him here for a reason. He...

441
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,286
 He thought that we were gonna walk out into those woods

442
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,369
 like Butch Cassidy and the motherfucking Sundance Kid!

443
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:00,211
 He thought that right up until the time

444
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,976
 one of those things slit his fucking throat!

445
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,139
 What did he do with his last breaths?

446
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,103
 He prayed.

447
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:17,028
 He gasped out that fucking prayer

448
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,072
 so that you would know.

449
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:26,077
 So that he could show you that he had never lost faith.

450
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,121
 You know what, motherfucker?

451
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,123
 I ain't here to pray.

452
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,207
 If you are anything other than some bedtime fucking story

453
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,211
 that we tell ourselves, then you will tell me why!

454
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:44,095
 Why you made me think I could fix this?

455
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:47,939
 Some kind of fucking hero gonna lead these people home,

456
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,461
 when all I am is a dumb motherfucker

457
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,545
 who keeps getting people killed!

458
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,427
 Damn it!

459
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:59,150
 You fuck. You think this is funny?

460
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:03,034
 Huh? You up there somewhere having a fucking laugh?

461
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,516
 Huh? Huh?

462
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:07,560
 Just... answer me!

463
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,841
 Answer me!

464
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:10,922
 Huh?

465
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,723
 Say something!

466
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,767
 You know...

467
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,891
 Tampering with a mailbox is a federal crime.

468
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:30,944
 Come in.

469
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,950
 How's she doing?

470
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,994
 She's getting worse.

471
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:44,237
 She's, um, she's getting cold.

472
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,210
 Is this really it?

473
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:04,137
 Is this how it ends?

474
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,022
 I don't know.

475
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:13,744
 You know, ever since she walked off that bus

476
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:16,988
 I actually allowed myself

477
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,712
 to believe that there was a plan to all of this.

478
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:27,800
 That there was something we were meant to do here.

479
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,843
 But there's no...

480
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,767
 There's no grand design.

481
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,171
 We're all gonna die here.

482
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:41,254
 And all this would have been for nothing.

483
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:47,220
 You know, my dad used to say,

484
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,540
 "It's hard to see the sweater

485
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,584
 "when you're only just a thread."

486
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,828
 I didn't really know what he meant 'til now.

487
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,393
 All of the people that have gotten stuck here...

488
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:07,040
 Maybe we aren't the ones that get to go home,

489
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:12,125
 but maybe what we did here

490
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,569
 makes it easier for the people who come next.

491
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,693
 Maybe we're the reason that they get to go home.

492
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,618
 Just because we're only a thread

493
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,662
 doesn't mean we don't matter.

494
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,552
 There ya go.

495
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,794
 Last thing you need is Khatri haunting you

496
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,838
 over everything else.

497
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,602
 It's too late for that.

498
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,169
 Julie and Marielle.

499
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,611
 Randall.

500
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,136
 Sara says they're dying.

501
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,296
 And once they're gone,

502
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:08,179
 there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.

503
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:11,222
 Whatever this thing is, it just waits for us

504
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,266
 to go to sleep and then...

505
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,267
 Like Paula.

506
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,311
 Yeah.

507
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,753
 She said the music box is there,

508
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,835
 right there in the clearing.

509
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:26,879
 Only it's not there.

510
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:30,761
 Like looking at an instruction manual

511
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,243
 with too many pages missing.

512
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,647
 How am I... How am I supposed...

513
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,092
 I saw my wife last night.

514
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:43,096
 How'd she look?

515
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,341
 There's gotta be rules, Donna.

516
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:54,305
 There's gotta be something I can hold in my hands.

517
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:56,349
 There's got to be so...

518
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,074
 I did this.

519
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,477
 I brought this thing back here.

520
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,160
 Yup. You sure did.

521
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:11,762
 You also gave a whole bunch of people a lot more time

522
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,806
 than they would've had if wasn't for you.

523
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,490
 You gave me more time.

524
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,454
 Your son is about to get married.

525
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,054
 Nothing official, I guess.

526
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,098
 It's not like we have a priest anymore.

527
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,184
 They're making the most of whatever time they have.

528
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:35,506
 You should do the same.

529
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,950
 Come back to Colony House with me.

530
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:43,514
 I'm not giving up.

531
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:46,397
 Did I say give up?

532
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:52,203
 Boyd, this may be the last few hours any of us get.

533
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,085
 So, why don't you just stop being a goddamn martyr

534
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,770
 and come and watch your son get married.

535
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,655
 The end of the world'll still be here when the ceremony's done.

536
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,694
 Anghkooey.

537
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:47,218
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

538
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,180
 Anghkooey.

539
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:50,901
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

540
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:54,505
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

541
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:58,148
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

542
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,391
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

543
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:03,113
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

544
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:06,757
 Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

545
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:10,921
 Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey!

546
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,965
 Anghkooey!

547
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:45,836
 Did your mother say anything else about the children?

548
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,880
 How was she gonna save them?

549
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,041
 I don't know. All she said was that

550
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,085
 they needed her.

551
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,769
 It's... It should be right... right here.

552
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,971
 No, no, no, no. These... These trees weren't...

553
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,254
 Hey, hey, hey. It was a long time ago, Victor.

554
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:07,938
 Maybe... Maybe we took the wrong turn.

555
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:11,221
 Over... Over here.

556
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,669
 Who put the bottles there?

557
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,432
 I don't know.

558
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:26,919
 This is where I found her.

559
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:30,160
 Your mom?

560
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:33,724
 Yeah, after everyone died, I came looking for her.

561
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,768
 Her body was...

562
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:42,294
 She didn't make it into the tree.

563
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:47,940
 What do you mean into the tree?

564
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,781
 Oh.

565
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,825
 Come.

566
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,991
 It's a faraway tree.

567
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
 The night the monsters got into Colony House,

568
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:14,004
 Julie said you both escaped by climbing into a tree.

569
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,966
 They always take you different places,

570
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,969
 and you never know where you'll end up,

571
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:22,893
 but my mother said this one was special.

572
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,775
 That it would take her to the tower,

573
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:26,817
 to the children.

574
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,859
 And then what?

575
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,903
 Uh...

576
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:34,066
 That's all I remember.

577
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,514
 Oh. Yeah. Here.

578
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,318
 I...

579
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:49,802
 I put some snacks inside for you.

580
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:53,566
 Here.

581
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:57,287
 Thank you, Victor.

582
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,331
 Yeah.

583
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,733
 Does it hurt to go through?

584
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,137
 No, it's just like walking through a door.

585
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:09,019
 Okay. Mm.

586
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,504
 Okay. Thank you.

587
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,350
 Now go back to town.

588
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:22,394
 Be careful.

589
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,117
 Yeah.

590
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:01,994
 Oh, my God.

591
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,254
 What are we doing?

592
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:26,457
 He wanted it to be a surprise.

593
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,621
 He wanted what to be a surprise?

594
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:34,424
 You're always saying that this view makes even this place

595
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,870
 look like a dream, so I figured.

596
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,672
 Is this okay?

597
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,716
 This is perfect.

598
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:54,044
 Hey, why don't we just go get him?

599
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,088
 He's got a lot on his mind, you know?

600
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,852
 Sheriff Stevens!

601
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:01,371
 You made it.

602
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,453
 What, are you kidding me?

603
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:05,497
 Wild horses couldn't stop me.

604
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,299
 Okay.

605
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:10,741
 Let's get this show on the road.

606
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:12,785
 Okay, wait. Um...

607
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,147
 I know it's not much of an aisle,

608
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:20,833
 but would you do me the honour?

609
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,400
 All right, you ready? Yeah.

610
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:33,125
 And you don't have to call me Sheriff Stevens anymore.

611
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,528
 Okay.

612
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,572
 Shall we?

613
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:01,433
 Ladies first.

614
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:04,276
 Okay. Um...

615
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:08,801
 My father had a saying.

616
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:12,923
 Well, he had a lot of sayings, actually, but...

617
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:17,449
 Um, my favourite one was always...

618
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:23,453
 "Life is a journey through the unknown,

619
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:27,017
 "and though your eyes and mind may sometimes

620
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,743
 "deceive you, your heart will never lie."

621
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:36,028
 My heart's belonged to you since the moment I met you.

622
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:42,432
 You're the love of my life,

623
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,476
 for as long as that life may last.

624
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:49,521
 So, will you, Ellis Stevens,

625
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,085
 do me the honour of being my husband?

626
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,049
 I will.

627
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,493
 I made you something.

628
00:44:11,063 --> 00:44:13,503
 Your turn.

629
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,708
 Oh, it's a tough act to follow.

630
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,752
 Um...

631
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,441
 The day my family and I saw that tree,

632
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:32,604
 our lives changed forever.

633
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,051
 But the day that I saw you get out of that car,

634
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:42,695
 that's the day that my life really began.

635
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:50,743
 There have been so many times here where I felt...

636
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,666
 like I was stumbling in the dark.

637
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,912
 But each and every time,

638
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,475
 you were the light that guided me through.

639
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:08,360
 You are my love.

640
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,483
 You are my home.

641
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,968
 You are my light in dark places.

642
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,332
 So...

643
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:22,853
 Will you,

644
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:25,177
 Fatima Hassan-Rostami...

645
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:29,501
 Will you do me the honour of being my wife?

646
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:34,787
 I will.

647
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,027
 Well, the rules say we kiss now.

648
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,919
 Boyd?

649
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,080
 Where'd you go?

650
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,124
 Are you okay, Dad?

651
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:54,726
 Light in dark places.

652
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:57,407
 I gotta go.

653
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:58,809
 I'm sorry.

654
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:00,853
 Hey. It's okay.

655
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,692
 Okay.

656
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:04,736
 Oh. Gosh.

657
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,619
 I love you guys.

658
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,019
 All right?

659
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:11,141
 Love you, too.

660
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,351
 Will we get to see Thomas again?

661
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:24,394
 What?

662
00:46:24,436 --> 00:46:26,116
 If we die.

663
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,160
 Will we get to see Thomas again?

664
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:43,455
 Yeah.

665
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:46,018
 Yeah, we will.

666
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,019
 Grandpa, too?

667
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:51,063
 Grandpa, too.

668
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,227
 Maybe it won't be so bad then.

669
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:03,675
 She likes to sleep with two pillows.

670
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,442
 Let me help you.

671
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:22,652
 Hey, Reggie?

672
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:24,534
 You did this.

673
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:26,937
 Everything was fine until you went into the forest.

674
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:29,019
 Hey. You're the reason all this is happening!

675
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:31,661
 Okay, hey, hey. Listen, listen to me!

676
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:33,223
 Listen to me.

677
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:35,946
 I know you don't understand this, I know,

678
00:47:35,988 --> 00:47:39,870
 but I think this torch, right here,

679
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,711
 I think this is gonna help me fix this.

680
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:45,715
 I'm sorry, Boyd.

681
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,237
 I always liked you.

682
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:51,681
 God!

683
00:47:56,808 --> 00:47:58,810
 Oh, fucking!

684
00:48:04,856 --> 00:48:05,936
 Fuck!

685
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,311
 Fuck.

686
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,602
 Motherfuck... Fuck.

687
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:34,927
 Fuck. Fuck.

688
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:44,416
 Come on.

689
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,507
 What?

690
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:18,008
 Julie! Hey. Julie!

691
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,052
 Hey, Julie. Hey, Julie.

692
00:49:20,973 --> 00:49:22,572
 Can you hear me?

693
00:49:22,614 --> 00:49:24,616
 Can you...

694
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,896
 I'm gonna get you out of here.

695
00:49:26,938 --> 00:49:28,940
 I'll get you outta here.

696
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:31,783
 I'm gonna get you outta here right now.

697
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:36,066
 We're getting outta here.

698
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:42,554
 Boyd!

699
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:46,356
 Please. Destroying that box isn't gonna end their suffering.

700
00:49:46,398 --> 00:49:48,038
 You'll only prolong it.

701
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,119
 No. I...

702
00:49:49,161 --> 00:49:52,562
 People in this town will suffer,

703
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:55,045
 in ways you can't even imagine.

704
00:49:55,087 --> 00:49:57,327
 They're all gonna die, screaming.

705
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:06,936
 What's wrong with her?

706
00:50:06,978 --> 00:50:08,418
 Hey! It's okay.

707
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,539
 What's wrong?

708
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:10,700
 What's wrong with her?

709
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,622
 Honey! Honey, please, please.

710
00:50:15,507 --> 00:50:17,667
 You think you need to be the hero.

711
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,430
 You think you need to be responsible, to save them.

712
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,993
 You don't have to suffer anymore.

713
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:24,274
 You don't have to be afraid.

714
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:26,596
 It's okay. None of this matters.

715
00:50:26,638 --> 00:50:27,837
 We can be together.

716
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,400
 I miss you so much.

717
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:34,204
 Wait, so, look, stop.

718
00:50:34,246 --> 00:50:38,168
 So, so whatever this thing is,

719
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,331
 it just lets you come in here for a little chat?

720
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:44,294
 It knows you won't listen. It wants you to fight.

721
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,776
 It wants you to have hope that you could actually win!

722
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:47,977
 Why?

723
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:51,661
 'Cause hope is what makes you willing to suffer.

724
00:50:51,703 --> 00:50:54,144
 Hope is what sent you out into the woods that day.

725
00:50:54,186 --> 00:50:57,829
 Hope is what made you leave me alone when I needed you most.

726
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:03,313
 It's not your fear that feeds the forest, Boyd.

727
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:05,195
 It's hope.

728
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,850
 Let it go, Boyd.

729
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:24,894
 If they don't die today, they'll just die tomorrow.

730
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,499
 No.

731
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:52,522
 Julie!

732
00:51:52,564 --> 00:51:54,766
 Oh, you're okay. Hey.

733
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:02,334
 Marielle, hey.

734
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:03,933
 Hi!

735
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:05,977
 What's going on?

736
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,470
 Oh, honey.

737
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:21,030
 She's okay.

738
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:23,074
 Oh, my God. Your sister's okay.

739
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,075
 Hi, baby. It's okay.

740
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:27,197
 It's okay, yes.

741
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:52,382
 Fuck you, motherfucker.

742
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:57,028
 You don't break me.

743
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,553
 You hear that?

744
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:06,678
 You don't fucking break me!

745
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:34,384
 Drink this.

746
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:35,745
 I'm fine.

747
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:36,906
 I know you are.

748
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:38,950
 Do it for me.

749
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,331
 There's no more buzzing.

750
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:13,385
 Does that mean it's over?

751
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:17,469
 I sure hope so.

752
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:22,914
 Dad?

753
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:27,519
 Where's Mom?

754
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:42,454
 Anghkooey.

755
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:45,977
 Hello?

756
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,081
 Anghkooey.

757
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,261
 Anghkooey.

758
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,908
 Anghkooey.

759
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,703
 I'm sorry.

760
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:13,503
 I really am.

761
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:15,547
 This is the only way.

762
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:46,097
 Oh.

763
00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:48,500
 Just a moment.

764
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:03,555
 Ow.

765
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,181
 How are you feeling?

766
00:57:35,547 --> 00:57:37,507
 Where am I?

767
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:40,550
 St. Anthony's Hospital. I'm Dr. Brody.

768
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:43,833
 Three days ago a pair of hikers found you in the woods.

769
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,478
 You were lying unconscious on the side of a trail.

770
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:50,159
 No.

771
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,522
 Do you remember what you were doing out there?

772
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,566
 No.

773
00:57:55,246 --> 00:57:56,726
 No.

774
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:58,770
 No, no, no, no, no.

775
00:58:00,652 --> 00:58:02,654
 No, no, no, no, no.
